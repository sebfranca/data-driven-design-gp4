# Using a Linter for the code.

0. Use flake8 on a standalone python 2 interpreter.

1. Install python 2 on a system with python 3 and run

python -m pip install flake8
python -m pip install flake8-html

2. In the root folder run:
flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake-report

3. Open index.html inside the flake-report folder.

4. Check the messages.

5. Delete the flake-report folder after use.

## Considerations:

* Specific errors can be ignored using "# noqa: F841".
  Use this very sparingly and only for specific errors in specific lines.


* F405: X may be undefined, or defined from star imports:
      Abaqus symbolic constants are OK to import as
      star imports, but this may hide very important errors.
      Make sure all variables under this message are
      Abaqus symbolic constants.
      All errors with this code can be listed for a file with:
      flake8 --format '%(text)s' --select F405 file_path | Select-String -Pattern "^'.*'" | foreach {$_.Matches.Value}
