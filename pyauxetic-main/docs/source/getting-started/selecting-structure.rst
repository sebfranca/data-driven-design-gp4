Selecting a Structure
=====================

The first step for using the software is to select the structure which is to be modeled. Generally, three different questions must be answered regarding the structure:
  
  + What is the basic unit cell used throughout the structure?
  + Do the  parameters of the unit cell change throughout the structure?
  + Does the structure undergo additional transformations?

These questions and their possible answers are discussed in the following sections.
