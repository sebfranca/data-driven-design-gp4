These are some useful commands for sphinx:

cd ./docs

! Create rst files for add all classes, modules, and packages to be used for autodoc.
sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../pyauxetic -f

! clean the build directory and build html.
make clean;make html

! build continuously
make clean;sphinx-autobuild source/ build/html/


!If autodoc can't import something, it's probably because python3 can't import it
!try to import modules using python3 and find the offending import statement.
