# pyAuxetic
Python plugin and library for modeling, analyzing, and post-processing auxetic structures in Abaqus.

# Introduction

PyAuxetic is a Python plugin and library for modeling, analyzing, and post-processing auxetic structures in Abaqus. Its main features are:
  
  + **Free**: The software is provided free of charge for non-commercial use. We use the GPL license that ensures that all derivative software are also free and open source.
  + **Open Source**: The entire code and documentation is open source and available on GitHub.
  + **Simple GUI**: The software has a simple and elegant GUI that interfaces to Abaqus as a plugin.
  + **Powerful API**: The software has powerfull API that can be used for scripting. All GUI functionality (and more) are available from the API. Scripting makes the results highly reproducible and the scripts can be archived.
  + **Extensible**: The software is built on a solid object-oriented framework, making it easily extensible. New structures and output types can be added with speed and reliability.
  + **Thorough Documentation**: We believe in documenting our methods. You can find in-depth documents about all aspects of the software in our online documentation.

# Contribution

We welcome all contributions. You can help in the following ways:
  
  + **Testing and Bug Reports**: We always appreciate testing various features and reporting any problems. You can use our GitHub issue tracker for bug reports.
  + **Example Problems**: While we provide entries for example problems, not all of them have been tested experimentally. We always appreciate users testing the concepts and structures in the real world. We will, of course, give appropriate citations when applicable.
  + **Documentation**: The software always needs more documentation. We use Sphinx which is very straightforward.
  + **New Features**: We appreciate implementation of new features. There are a few ways to go about this:
    - If you can add features using the object-oriented approach, submit a pull request, and we will review your code.
    - If you can write the code using Abaqus' Python API but would rather not bother with the object-oriented framework, you can send us scripts, and we may be able to add them to the software. Make sure to say this in your feature request.
    - If you have a new concept that you think can add value to the scientific community, send the maintainer of the repository (M. Khoshbin) a private message on GitHub. We may be able to collaborate in a scientific framework.
