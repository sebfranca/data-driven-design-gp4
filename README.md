# Auxetic material structural optimization using Abaqus (Main branch)

### Authors : Julie CHOUVALIDZE, Cédric FONTAINE, Sébastien FRANCA

Welcome to our repository for the *Data-driven design (ME-428 @ EPFL)* final project. All the useful code is located on the following branches :

* cedric : bayesian optimization and whole pipeline for the structural optimization
* jujuu : some optimization examples
* sensitivity : code for the sensitivity analysis

## How-to

In order to use our code, please perform the following steps (after having pulled the repo):

* Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Put the `pyauxetic-main` directory inside your Abaqus installation directory, i.e. `C:/SIMULIA/Abaqus/6.14-1/code/python2.7/lib`
* Enjoy !
